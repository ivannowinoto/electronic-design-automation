PA3: Detailed Routing for Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs)

1. Problem Description
    This assignment requires implementing a detailed router for Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs). Unlike traditional metal routing, PIC waveguides are allowed to cross each other but with additional loss. Given:
    - Grid size (horizontal × vertical),
    - Propagation loss,
    - Crossing loss,
    - Bending loss,
    - A list of 2-pin nets,

    your task is to route all nets on the grid using only horizontal and vertical line segments. The objective is to minimize the total waveguide loss, which is composed of:
    - Propagation loss = α × total wire length,
    - Crossing loss = β × number of crossings,
    - Bending loss = γ × number of 90-degree turns.

2. Input Format
    The input file contains:
    grid H V               # grid dimension
    propagation loss α
    crossing loss β
    bending loss γ
    num net N             # number of nets

    Each net has:
    net_id xs ys xt yt    # net ID, source (xs, ys), target (xt, yt)

    All values are integers.

3. Output Format
    For each net, output:
    [net_id] [k = number of routed segments]
    [x11] [y11] [x12] [y12]
    [x21] [y21] [x22] [y22]
    ...
    [xk1] [yk1] [xk2] [yk2]

    Rules:
    - Only horizontal/vertical segments are allowed (no diagonals).
    - First segment must start at (xs, ys); last segment must end at (xt, yt).
    - Adjacent segments must connect: the end of segment i must equal the start of segment i+1.

4. Objective Calculation Example
    Total waveguide loss = propagation_length × α + number_of_crossings × β + number_of_bends × γ.

5. Hints
    Model the grid as a graph where:
    - Each grid point is a node,
    - Each movement to an adjacent grid costs propagation loss,
    - Crossing and bending penalties can be incorporated into dynamic or incremental cost updates.

    Path searching algorithms (e.g., BFS, Dijkstra, A*) can be applied.

6. Language and Platform
    Language: C or C++
    Platform: Unix/Linux
    Execution format:
    ./picRouting <input_file> <output_file>

7. Submission Requirements
    Submit a compressed file named:
    [student id]-p3.tgz
    containing a single folder:
    [student id]-p3

    Items to include:
    1. Source code
    2. Makefile
    3. readme.txt (how to build/run)
    4. report.docx (≤ 2 pages, explains data structures and algorithms)

    Rules:
    - Filenames and folder names must use lowercase
    - Only *.tgz format is accepted
    - Submission must compile and run correctly on Linux
    - Incorrect format or missing files will incur penalties

8. Grading Policy
    Grading is based on:
    1. Correctness (all nets must be connected with no breaks)
    2. Solution quality (total waveguide loss)
    3. Runtime (≤ 10 minutes per test; grid up to 100×100 with up to 1000 nets)
    4. Proper submission format
